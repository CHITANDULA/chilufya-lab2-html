This project is a hands-on lab designed to teach the fundamentals of creating well-structured HTML5 webpages with semantic elements and built-in form validation. The key objectives include:

(i) HTML5 Structure: Building a webpage using semantic elements such as <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>.
(ii) Form Validation: Implementing HTML5 forms with required fields and validation rules (e.g., email format, minimum character length).
(iii) Code Validation: Ensuring the HTML code is error-free using the W3C Validator.
(iv) Version Control: Publishing the project on GitHub using Git for version control.

Deliverables include a validated HTML file (index.html), a project description in README.md, and a GitHub repository link. By completing this lab, I gain practical experience in semantic HTML coding, form validation, debugging, and version control.
